Hey there, you are probably wondering what this is. you most likely got here by seeing a random link somewhere posted by me, or
you found this link in my code somewhere, truth is, i dont know what this page is, Just kidding. this page is to make sure all my sites
are responding, if it doeset show this page, it means the site is most likly down. i use this page becuase its just a static html.
so you can stay here or go back to the main site, its up to you. my main site is firetime.me
also i may put some random stuff in here for fun if it want to

Sencerly, FireTime

P.S. If the ascii art doesent show. it means the html is not working or something. i dont know and i dont feel like fixing it
