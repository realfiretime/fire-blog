Hey there, you are probably wondering what this is. you most likely got here by seeing a random link somewhere posted by me, or
you found this link in my code somewhere, truth is, i dont know what this page is, Just kidding. this page is to make sure all my sites
are responding, If this page shows, it means the site is down. if it doesent, it means the site is up and workking.
if the site is up and working and your here, you most likly traced this link from some codebase of mine.
so you can stay here or go back to the main site, its up to you. my main site is firetime.me
also i may put some random stuff in here for fun if it want to

Sencerly, FireTime


PS- You can contact me at firetime@firetime.me for any help. 
Have a great day!

This page will show up on any browser as it is just straight html.
yes, it will even show up in your terminal, the ascii art may
not show but the text will :) 
accualy wait, the ascii art uses the pre> prefix or whatever it is,
so im fine, and it styles it to show the ascii, forget what i said
maby, i dont know, ok im talking too much. see ya
