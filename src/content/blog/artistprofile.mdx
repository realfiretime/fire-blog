Hey there, 
im just making this post because spotify <i class="fa-brands fa-spotify fa-shake" style="color: #669c35;"></i> "can’t connect your email address to the artist." for my spotify for artist page. so 
i am putting my email firetime@firetime.me at the footer on the site and also making this post so spotify will see it. 
Have a great day everyone !
